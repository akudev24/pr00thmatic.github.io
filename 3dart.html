              <p>Working as a 3D Artist inside for a game development team</p>

            <p>
              Working at VReality I've helped complete 3D Assets whenever the 3D artist was busy with another projects (or another assets!), that's one of the things I love the most about this studio: I can always lend a hand in almost any area.
            </p>

            <p>
              While developing a game for Arcor and Paw Patrol I helped creating secondary 3D models for every minigame. Let me tell you: having a developer and a 3D Artist is very helpful for an indie studio because this dev can create his own assets exactly the way he needs them so they can be seamlesly integrated into the game.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="images/ready to integrate.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: contain" />
            </p>

            <p>
              So I wanted to try something very interesting to seamlessly generate an infinite runner 3D environment, but by the time the 3D artist was really busy retopologizing the highpoly models of some pups, so I lend a hand by making the 3D assets necessary for the infinite runner minigame, and I also implemented it!

                    <p>Hi! I am Ruth García AKA: pr00thmatic. I love gamedev!</p>

                    <p>I started as a 2D artist in the GGJ2014 and then jumped right into javascript and phaser.
                      When the opportunity to work as a freelancer game developer came to me, I was required to learn Unity, Arduino and Playcanvas. </p>

                    <p>I love learning to work with new engines and technology for any gamedev-related thing.</p>

                    <p>I have a programmer's heart, it's my favorite thing in the world.
                      I've been in love with videogames since I was a toddler, from playing them to develop them.
                      That’s the reason why I also learned to be a generalist, it's amazing all the process involved on making games.</p>

                    <p>So... by all means! please feel free to contact me in any social network to chat about game development.</p>

                    <p>I am Bolivian/Guatemalan developer so it’s my pleasure to work with you, even if my grammar isn’t perfect.</p>
