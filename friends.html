                      <p>
                        In my role as a self-taught 3D artist, I have completed many personal projects following the workflow needed to work with real time engines. Moreover, I am very familiarized with Unity’s rendering pipelines, I feel very comfortable using HDRP, URP, or the Build-in Renderer. You can check some sample 3d objects on my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/ivanochoa">Artstation profile</a>. These models were built to be used in Unity’s URP and HDRP.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The main tools that I use are Blender(for 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, and assigning color ids), Substance Painter(for texturing, and baking all the necessary maps), and Unity (for rendering). Furthermore, in order to apply materials for the models that I make, the prop’s materials are created with a PBR workflow. Lastly, I also have skills in the programming side so that I can communicate and understand better with people from other areas on the team. I know very well C#, C++, and Java

                        Sergio is a friend and co-workers of mine at VReality. Working with him has been very pleasent, he is a fast learner and tackles the harder problems in the most practical and creative ways, as a gamer and friend of game developers, he is familiar with the game design concepts and can provide very useful feedback on how to improve the gameplay of a game. He is also a quick learner and can easily adopt new technologies.

                      <p>
                        His background in other programming areas has give him a very interesting bank of logical knowledge that he can apply everywhere, also, as he knows about other areas beside game programming, he is able to help the team in ways outside of the production of a game.

                        When I started to become an active gamedev at twitter, a great spanish-speaker community greeted me, most of them belonged to the "TODO GameDev" and were friends with a cool dude called "Watanoge", he was organizing this gamejam series called "mejorando ando", it was more than a game jam, it was a series of game jams in which you could win points and spend them in Watanoge's store (things like: games, domains, licenses), everything payed from his own pocket. It reminded me to those arcade machines in which you would play and earn tickets to buy gifts at the store with them... it was a lot of fun!
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        That contest gave life and motivation to hundreds of game developers across the world, nowadays, he and a bunch of his friends are together with a common quest: to breathe life into the long-time-dead Mexico's IGDA, they are a multidisciplinary young and powerful mexican team, and they are helping gamedevs, not only from México, but from all across the world to become better at gamedeving.

                      <p>
                        They are having a hard time getting scolarships for their community for the GDC, and I think that they deserve to have scolarship, they work so hard and help so much! so, by any means, if you think you can giv'em a hand, please contact them!

                    <p>Hi! I am Ruth García AKA: pr00thmatic. I love gamedev!</p>

                    <p>I started as a 2D artist in the GGJ2014 and then jumped right into javascript and phaser.
                      When the opportunity to work as a freelancer game developer came to me, I was required to learn Unity, Arduino and Playcanvas. </p>

                    <p>I love learning to work with new engines and technology for any gamedev-related thing.</p>

                    <p>I have a programmer's heart, it's my favorite thing in the world.
                      I've been in love with videogames since I was a toddler, from playing them to develop them.
                      That’s the reason why I also learned to be a generalist, it's amazing all the process involved on making games.</p>

                    <p>So... by all means! please feel free to contact me in any social network to chat about game development.</p>

                    <p>I am Bolivian/Guatemalan developer so it’s my pleasure to work with you, even if my grammar isn’t perfect.</p>
