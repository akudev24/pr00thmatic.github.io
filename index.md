### The old site

Are you looking for a very "edgy" looking website? then you are going to love my old website! (otherwise... i am sorry for what you are about to see). Here I have some of my old games (everything is in spanish tho')... aaahhh the good ol' days when I used to code in Phaser. It has been like 3? 4? years since then. Now I use Unity, and I am doing a living by developing cool stuff using it!

### Some hackathon-ey games

So... during May, there was this very hardcore hackathon hosted by Argentina Game Jam, where I joined forces with an awesome team. We didn't know each other, but we ended up creating 4 awesome games in one month!

Do you wanna take a look? They are really awesome!

#### Zombie Movie Break
This is Zombie Movie Break, a doom-like game about shooting at zombies in order to almost-kill-them, and then healing them!

#### I'm not a BARMAN
In I'm not a BARMAN, you try to BE a barman (even tho' you are clearly NOT a barman). It's a 1st person job simulator, in which you mix drinks for your customers.

#### Mr Gudvoi
Mr. Gudvoi is a Good Boy that works in an office, he's having a bad time trying to be a "good fit" for the company... you see, it's hard for a doggo to make friends when smelling butts is a big no-no, but the main problem is that he can't understand what hoomans say.

#### Glow
This game was elected winner on the 1-month very-hardcore hackathon hosted by Argentina Game Jam!

Glow is a top-to-down hack and slash game about moral decissions, where you play as a light creature, and you help him take decissions in order to unlock new places.

This month was a lot of fun (and a lot of hard work), we ended up with a ton of new games, and it was the first time that we worked together! even we were surprised with the results XD

### Outdated Portfolio in pdf

The last year the ABV (Bolivian Videogame Association) gifted me a GDC scholarship! I was so excited, but then... covid happened :(

Anyway, I have an outdated portfolio that I made to apply to the scholarship! and here it is:

### why is this under construction and very outdated?

*that's not very proffessional of you*

I know :( I am sorry :'(

During 2020 I have had more work than ever! I am currently working for 3 companies as part-time, I've been working with a team of proffessionals, learning a lot about new technologies, polishing what I already knew about Unity, finding new things I didn't knew about Unity... overall, having a lot of fun!

And I know that working 12 hours a day is a lot of work, but right now, with this pandemy, this is exactly what I need... after all... All I wanna do is become big game developer, and help others to build awesome games!

But this leaves me very short of time :(
